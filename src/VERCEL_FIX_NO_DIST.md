# 🔧 Fix "No Output Directory 'dist' Found" Error on Vercel

## 🎯 The Real Issue

The error "No Output Directory named 'dist' found" means **the build is failing BEFORE creating the dist folder**, not that Vercel can't find it.

---

## ✅ Solution 1: Configure Vercel Project Settings (EASIEST)

Instead of relying on vercel.json, configure directly in Vercel dashboard:

### **Step 1: Go to Vercel Project Settings**

1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click on your **paras-sfx-library** project
3. Click **"Settings"** tab at the top

### **Step 2: Configure Build & Development Settings**

Scroll down to **"Build & Development Settings"** and set:

```
Framework Preset: Vite
Build Command: npm run build
Output Directory: dist
Install Command: npm install
Development Command: npm run dev
```

**IMPORTANT:** Make sure "Override" is checked for each setting!

### **Step 3: Configure Root Directory**

In **"Root Directory"** section:
```
Root Directory: ./
```
(Just a dot and slash, or leave it blank)

### **Step 4: Redeploy**

1. Go to **"Deployments"** tab
2. Click the **three dots (⋮)** on the latest deployment
3. Click **"Redeploy"**
4. Check **"Use existing build cache"** = OFF
5. Click **"Redeploy"**

## ✅ Solution 2: Check Build Logs for Actual Error

The "No dist folder" error is a symptom, not the cause. Check what's actually failing:

### **Step 1: View Build Logs**

1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Click on the failed deployment
3. Click **"Building"** section to expand it
4. **Scroll through the logs** looking for errors BEFORE the "No dist folder" error

### **Step 2: Look for These Common Errors**

**TypeScript Errors:**
```
error TS2307: Cannot find module './something'
error TS2345: Type 'X' is not assignable to type 'Y'
```
→ **Fix:** I've already made TypeScript less strict in tsconfig.json

**Missing Dependencies:**
```
Error: Cannot find module 'some-package'
```
→ **Fix:** The package.json I created should have all dependencies

**Import Path Errors:**
```
Error: Failed to resolve import "./Component" from "App.tsx"
```
→ **Fix:** Check that all imports use correct paths

**Memory/Timeout Errors:**
```
FATAL ERROR: Reached heap limit
```
→ **Fix:** Add this to package.json scripts

## ✅ Solution 3: Update package.json Build Script

If the build is running out of memory or timing out:

<function_calls>
<invoke name="read">
<parameter name="path">/package.json
